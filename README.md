# BINGO!

Lets play BINGO!

## How to play

There are two types of participants in this game.
The `runner` and `player`.
There can only be one runner, and any number of players.

### Inform new players

The `runner` should inform new players what to expect.
Tell them to "whisper !help to me", and help explain anything they might want to know.

The `!tips` command does explain using paper and pencil for this.
Help them understand that a physical card in front of them will be easier to work with.

### Help new players get a card

Explain that `!card 1` will give them at least 1 card.
That they can have up to 10 cards right now.

Also explain that cards are for specific characters, not players.
That each character will need their own card(s).

### Explain the card ID

Help new players understand that they can interact with thier cards using the card IDs.

`!show <ID>` and `!return <ID>` both need a specific ID.

## Run the game

As a runner, gather the players in a space, or in a group.
Start the game with `/bingo <channel>` where channel can be: `guild, raid, party, say, or yell`.
Using `guild` might be considered spammy, as it will post up to 75 lines.

Help the players understand that they need to call `BINGO!` in the same channel as the game is announcing balls.

## Command overview

### Slash commands:

Use `reset` to stop and reset a game.
Use in case you need to restart a game, or shut it down early.

`help` will explain the channel options.

### ! commands:

Whisper `!help` to yourself to get a list of the commands.

## General Help

### Using a physical card.

I've found that using 3x5 index cards makes things easier.
Use 2 index cards per card you are playing.

On the first one, write:

> Character Name
>
> Card ID
>
> B  I  N  G  O
>
> The card numbers.

On the second one, write:

| B | I | N | G | O |
| --- | --- | --- |  --- |  --- |
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |

I have found that doing this, you can use the blank multiple times.
Use different markings for each game.
Which also means that you can use it with multiple characters, or with multiple cards.
